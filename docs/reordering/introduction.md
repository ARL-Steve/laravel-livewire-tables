The previous iteration utilised third-party Sortable plugins, which are not required for Version 3.x, and are not supported in Livewire 3.x at the time of writing.

## An update about reordering

Version 2.0 returned all rows for sorting.  In version 3.0, you will be able to sort with the items on the currently visible page, which allows for sorting on larger tables.  

If you have a large data set to sort, then it is recommended that you create a minimal table instance with only the required columns for performance reasons.
